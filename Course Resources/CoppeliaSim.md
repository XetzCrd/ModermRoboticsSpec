"Experiment with CoppeliaSim. I suggest you choose File > Open scene... and open one of the example "scenes" that comes with the software. CoppeliaSim "scenes" are specifications of environments, robots, and their actions, and when you press the "play" button the simulation begins. Experimenting with these scenes will show you some of the capabilities of CoppeliaSim. For example, you could choose the "pathPlanning/path_planning_and_grasping.ttt" scene. (All scene files end in .ttt.) "
